### MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a way to keep your personal information secure online. By verifying that you are actually you, websites that use MFA help cut down on identity theft and loss of personal data.

### WHY AUTHENTICATION?

If a website does not offer MFA, all an identity thief needs to do to gain access to your account is enter your username and password. MFA provides a next step by checking that you -- and not just anyone -- is trying to access your information.

For example, a site may send a text message directly to your phone. This message contains a short number that you then enter into the website as part of the login process. Because the identity thief doesn't have your phone, they can't access your account.

### LEARN TO BROWSE SAFELY

This extension is designed to help you learn about the sites that you visit. The extension displays several important metrics about the MFA and encryption techniques a website offers.

Knowing which sites use multi-factor authentication and strong encryption practices can help you decide where to share your personal information.
