            <h2>What is Multi-factor Authentication?</h2>
            <p>
                Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a way to keep your personal information secure online. By verifying that you are actually you, websites that use MFA help cut down on identity theft and loss of personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in keeping your information secure is to use a strong password. Once you've successfully entered your username and password into a website, multi-factor authentication serves as a next step in keeping your identity secure. One common MFA method for verifying your identity involves texting you a verification code. That way, even if a hacker knows your password, they won't be able to access your data without your phone.

            <h2>Where should you use Multi-factor Authentication?</h2>
            <p>
                Anywhere you'd like to keep your information safe! For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Online banking
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email
                </li>
                <li>
                    Filing taxes
                </li>
            </ul>
